# Message Modes Cookbook

Understanding the different modes and flags available for sending messages is crucial to ensure that your smart contracts behave as intended.
While [message modes](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes) section provided detailed descriptions of these modes and flags, in this section we will illustrate their practical application through specific examples.

#### Message value and account balance

Please check how [get_balance](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#get_balance) works to better understand the transaction state.

There are two ways to pay for blockchain action:

- From the [message value](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/msg-tlb#commonmsginfo)
- From the [contract balance](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/block.tlb#L263C1-L265C20)

Typically, it is charged from the contract `balance`, but in specific cases, it will use part of the message `value`.

#### Fees

Actual transaction fees will vary depending on the blockchain configuration, the smart contract code and other factors. When a message is received, part of the contract `balance` will be consumed by [storage fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#storage-fee) and gas_fees if the message `value` [is above certain amount](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#compute-phase-skipped).

According to the [transaction flow](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases) there are 5 phases:

- Storage, consisting of [account storage](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L651-L675) and [in_msg import](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L783-L816)
- [Credit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L959-L981), where in_msg `value` is added to the `balance`
- Compute, where the actual smart contract code is executed in TVM
- Action, where actions like `SENDRAWMSG` are performed
- Bounce, where everything about bouncing is handled

The order is: storage_fee -> import_fee -> gas_fee -> action_fee + fwd_fee

:::info IMPORTANT
The table is populated based on [this example](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/b5e14a9c4a4e982fda42d6079c3f84fa48e76497a8f3fca872f9a3737f1f6262). You can check the [**live calculator**](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#basic-fees-formula).

## 1. Send a regular message

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

**A** sent 0.1 TON to **B**, [msg_fwd_fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#forward-fees) are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `value`.

State after transaction: Account A has 0.9 TON, Account B has 1.096 TON

![](/img/docs/message-modes-cookbook/send_regular_message_1.png)

| :-------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `mode` = 0, no `flag` | `send_raw_message(msg, 0)` |

## 2. Send a regular message, no bounce the message on error and ignore it

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

**A** sent 0.1 TON to **B**, `msg_fwd_fees` are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `value`.
In case of an error during transaction processing, the message will not bounce and will be ignored.

State after transaction: Account A has 0.9 TON, Account B has 1.096 TON

:::info tip
Funds included with an ignored message will still be [credited to the receiving address](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/8a388731812c80ab9b0ea9531108425488af5def854e4bd6f0ed47362b56d557).
